    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fragrant ice cream is redolent with flavor. It's traditionally served between two thin wafers to make ice cream sandwiches, but it's equally delicious on its own.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron, finely ground</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pure rosewater, preferably Sadaf brand</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Dried roses, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a medium bowl in a large bowl of ice water. In another medium bowl, beat the egg yolks until pale, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk the cream with the milk, sugar, salt and saffron. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat, whisking, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Very gradually whisk half of the hot cream mixture into the beaten egg yolks in a thin stream, then whisk this mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the custard is thick enough to lightly coat the back of the spoon, about 12 minutes; don’t let it boil.</li>
        <li>Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into the bowl set in the ice water. Let the custard cool completely, stirring occasionally. Stir in the rosewater and vanilla extract. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard base into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer the ice cream to a chilled 9-by-4-inch metal loaf pan, cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Serve the ice cream in bowls, garnished with dried roses.</li>
    </ol>
